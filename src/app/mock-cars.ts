      'The Audi A3 is a subcompact executive/small family car (Euro NCAP)/C-segment (European Commission) manufactured and marketed since the 1990s[1][2] by the German automaker Audi subdivision of the Volkswagen Group, currently in its fourth generation. The first two generations of the Audi A3 were based on the Volkswagen Group A platform, which they share with the Audi TT, Volkswagen Golf, Volkswagen Caddy, and Volkswagen Touran, as well as SEAT León, SEAT Toledo, and Škoda Octavia.

    details: `The Audi A4 is a line of compact executive cars produced since 1994 by the German car manufacturer Audi, a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group.
    The A4 has been built in five generations and is based on the Volkswagen Group B platform. The first generation A4 succeeded the Audi 80. The automaker's internal numbering treats the A4 as a continuation of the Audi 80 lineage, with the initial A4 designated as the B5-series, followed by the B6, B7, B8, and the B9. The B8 and B9 versions of the A4 are built on the Volkswagen Group MLB platform shared with many other Audi models and potentially one Porsche model within Volkswagen Group.[2]
    The Audi A4 automobile layout consists of a front-engine design, with transaxle-type transmissions mounted at the rear of the engine. The cars are front-wheel drive, or on some models, "quattro" all-wheel drive.
    The A4 is available as a sedan and station wagon. Historically, the second (B6) and third generations (B7) of the A4 also included a convertible version. For the fourth generation (B8) and onwards, the convertible, along with a new coupé and 5-door liftback variant, was spun-off by Audi into a new nameplate called the Audi A5.`,

    description: 'Compact executive coupe, cabriolet and liftback.',
    details: `The Audi A5 is a series of compact executive coupe cars produced by the German automobile manufacturer Audi since June 2007. The A5 range additionally comprises the coupe, cabriolet, and "Sportback" (a five-door liftback with a fastback roofline) version of the Audi A4 saloon and estate models.
    Under Audi's internal platform numbering convention, the A5 is a member of the B-platform series of vehicles, sharing its platform designation with the A4 saloon and Avant. The first generation A5 (Type 8T) is therefore a member of the B8 family, whilst the second generation model (Type 8W6) is based on the B9.[1] Both are derived from the Volkswagen MLB (Modular Longitudinal Matrix) architecture.`,

    details: `The Audi A6 is an executive car made by the German automaker Audi. Now in its fifth generation, the successor to the Audi 100 is manufactured in Neckarsulm, Germany, and is available in saloon and estate configurations, the latter marketed by Audi as the Avant. Audi's internal numbering treats the A6 as a continuation of the Audi 100 lineage, with the initial A6 designated as a member of the C4-series, followed by the C5, C6, C7, and the C8. The related Audi A7 is essentially a Sportback (liftback) version of the C7-series[1] and C8-series A6 but is marketed under its own separate identity and model designation.
    All generations of the A6 have offered either front-wheel-drive or Torsen-based four-wheel-drive, marketed by Audi as their quattro system. The A6 has also been used as the basis for the company's Allroad models since 1999.
    Both petrol and diesel versions of the A6 are offered. The wide range of engines available have power outputs ranging from 150 to 333 PS (110 to 245 kW). These are inline four-cylinder turbocharged engines and more powerful 3-litre units in a V6 configuration with a mechanical compressor.`,

    description: 'F-segment/full-size luxury sedan.',
    details: `The Audi A8 is a four-door, full-size, luxury sedan manufactured and marketed by the German automaker Audi since 1994. Succeeding the Audi V8, and now in its fourth generation, the A8 has been offered with both front- or permanent all-wheel drive—and in short- and long-wheelbase variants. The first two generations employed the Volkswagen Group D platform, with the current generation deriving from the MLB platform. After the original model's 1994 release, Audi released the second generation in late 2002, the third in late 2009, and the fourth and current iteration in 2017.
    Noted as the first mass-market car with an aluminium chassis, all A8 models have used this construction method co-developed with Alcoa and marketed as the Audi Space Frame.
    A mechanically-upgraded, high-performance version of the A8 debuted in 1996 as the Audi S8. Produced exclusively at Audi's Neckarsulm plant, the S8 is fitted standard with Audi's quattro all-wheel drive system, and is available in short- and long-wheelbase form`,
